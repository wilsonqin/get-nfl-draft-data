Known Issues:

1. Does not support names that need a lot of disambiguation, even within the football category. E.g. Mike Adams: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Adams. Who was a football safety of one era, and an offensive tackle of another: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Adams_(offensive_tackle).

2. Currently only gets the draft pick data for the NFL Draft, and does not produce data for Supplemental Drafts. E.g. Terrelle Pryor (2011 Supplemental Draft, 3rd Round).

3. Only produces technically TSV - tab separated files currently (hard coded). Could be changed to be CSV option too.
