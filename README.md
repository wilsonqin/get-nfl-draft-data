Get NFL Draft Data Script
By Wilson Qin

I wrote this script originally in September 2015
to help a friend gather NFL Draft Data for a statistical project.

The data sources are the Wikipedia.org football player pages from the American Football category.

Usage:
  run: `python get_nfl_draft_data.py <player names file> <output file>`

  run with `--help` for further options
